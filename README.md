# data-anlysis

🔍 Project Overview
I selected the Heart Attack Prediction in Indonesia dataset from Kaggle, expecting to clean and preprocess it. However, I found that the dataset was already well-structured with minimal missing values.

So instead of extensive cleaning, I focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

🛠️ Steps I Followed
1️⃣ Loaded the dataset into MySQL for structured analysis.
2️⃣ Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies (found very few).
3️⃣ Performed EDA to identify relationships between features affecting heart attack risk.
4️⃣ Visualized the patterns to gain deeper insights into the data.

🚀 Key Findings
Based on my analysis, the following factors increase the risk of heart attacks:

1.Income Level: People with low and medium income are more prone.

2.Smoking: Active smokers have a higher risk.

3.Alcohol Consumption: Individuals who consume alcohol are more prone.

4.Pollution Exposure: People with moderate exposure to pollution are at increased risk.

5.Stress Levels: Individuals with moderate or high stress levels are more likely to suffer from heart attacks.
